            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The Lab 1 project successfully integrated an ESP32 microcontroller with sensors, an LCD display, and a Java GUI
                to monitor temperature data in real-time. Utilizing Firebase Realtime Database, the system enables cloud-based 
                communication between hardware and software components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key features include user-defined temperature thresholds, automated email notifications, and graphical data 
                visualization. Initially implemented in C++, challenges with GUI and HTTP libraries prompted a switch to Java, 
                leveraging Swing and JFreeChart for robust interface and graph functionality.
